Frankfurter is a free, open-source currency data API that tracks reference exchange rates published by institutional and non-commercial sources like the European Central Bank.

No usage caps or API keys. Works great client-side in the browser or mobile apps. The public API is available at api.frankfurter.dev. If preferred, you can self-host.

Usage
Frankfurter provides endpoints to retrieve latest rates, historical data, or time series.

function convert(from, to, amount) {
  fetch(`https://api.frankfurter.dev/v1/latest?base=${from}&symbols=${to}`)
    .then((resp) => resp.json())
    .then((data) => {
      const convertedAmount = (amount * data.rates[to]).toFixed(2);
      alert(`${amount} ${from} = ${convertedAmount} ${to}`);
    });
  }

convert("EUR", "USD", 10);

Quick answers
Is the API free for commercial use?
Yes, absolutely.
Does the API have any call limits?
There are no limits. However, for high-volume queries, itâ€™s more efficient to query the European Central Bank data directly from your server than using our API.
Will the API work in the future?
We've been running for over a decade and have no plans to shut down. For critical applications, we recommend self-hosting for greater control.
What is the privacy policy of the API?
The API itself does not collect personal data. However, the public app runs behind Cloudflare for performance, and Cloudflare will collect some basic information for analytics. This does not apply if you run the API privately.
What should I do if a currency is missing?
If you notice a currency missing from our data, please open an issue and include a suggested source with the missing data. We're looking for non-commercial sources that publish current and historical daily rates at the end of each working day.
